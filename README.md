# Digit_Classification

* Reorganization of repo; old one was in a weird parent directory (originally completed Dec 2020)
* Utilized MNIST digit database to recognize handwritten digits using a CNN. 
* Programmed a G.U.I. in Python to allow the user to draw a digit (0-999) that the model could predict.

Data for training and testing can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv. MNIST_DigitClassifier_v4.ipynb contains the code to create the image recognition model; MNIST_PredictNumber.py contains the code for the GUI and the prediction interface.
